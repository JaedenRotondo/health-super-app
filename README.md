## IBDCare 
#### Motivation: 
This app creates single place for patients with Inflammatory Bowel Disease (IBD) to contact their healthcare practitioners, manage their disease activity, and track their medication. IBD is on the rise in Canada with 2.44% increase year over year, according to the NIH [source](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC10478802/#:~:text=In%20Canada%2C%20the%20prevalence%20of,year%20over%20the%20next%20decade.). Being a chronic illness, those with IBD need to be followed medical for the rest of their life, and disease activity within this period is susceptable to change. Considering that many patients live in rural areas, the introduction of telemedicine has become more and more popular. According to a Springer Nature article [source](https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/s11894-020-0751-0), telemedicine has been shown to be a safe and effective approach in IBD care. Additionally, it helps reduce the financial burden of managing chronic disease, enhances patient quality of life, and contributes to better clinical outcomes.

User Research and Persona Creation:
â€¢ Conduct user research: Describe the methods you would use to gather insights into the
target users' needs, challenges, and behaviors. This could include surveys, interviews, or
secondary research.

For user research, I used interviews as well as secondary research. The reason being that the user base for a chronic health app specifically talored to patients with IBD is rather small. Instance of IBD in Canada
