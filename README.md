### Introduction  
Welcome! My name is **Jaeden**, and this is a guide to developing the UI behind a **telemedicine app** for individuals with **chronic illnesses**. Below, I outline my process in designing a **UI and UX** tailored to its respective users using research methods.  

### Motivation  
This app serves as a **centralized platform** for **patients with Inflammatory Bowel Disease (IBD)** to:  
- Contact their healthcare practitioners  
- Manage their disease activity  
- Track their medication  

IBD is rising in **Canada**, with a **2.44% year-over-year increase**, according to the **NIH** ([source](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC10478802/#:~:text=In%20Canada%2C%20the%20prevalence%20of,year%20over%20the%20next%20decade.)). Being a **chronic illness**, IBD requires **lifelong medical monitoring**, with disease activity fluctuating over time. Since many patients live in **rural areas**, **telemedicine** has emerged as a crucial tool.  

According to a **Springer Nature** article ([source](https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/s11894-020-0751-0)), telemedicine in **IBD care** is:  
- **Safe and effective**  
- **Financially beneficial** for chronic disease management  
- **Enhances patient quality of life**  
- **Improves clinical outcomes**  

## User Research and Persona Creation  

To conduct **user research**, I used **interviews** and **secondary research**. The **small user base** for an **IBD-focused chronic health app** made these the most viable options. **Secondary literature** on IBD and telemedicine is extensive, and **interviews** can provide qualitative insights from a targeted audience.

- **Prototype**: Develop a **clickable prototype** using **Figma, Adobe XD, or another tool** to showcase the main features and user flow.  

## Usability Testing  
- **Plan a usability test**: Define a usability testing plan including goals, user tasks, and how feedback is collected.  
- **Analyze feedback**: Outline methods to interpret user feedback and iterate on the design.
