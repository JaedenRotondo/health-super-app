## IBDCare 
#### Motivation: 
This app creates a single place for patients with Inflammatory Bowel Disease (IBD) to contact their healthcare practitioners, manage their disease activity, and track their medication. IBD is on the rise in Canada with 2.44% increase year over year, according to the NIH [source](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC10478802/#:~:text=In%20Canada%2C%20the%20prevalence%20of,year%20over%20the%20next%20decade.). Being a chronic illness, those with IBD need to be followed medical for the rest of their life, and disease activity within this period is susceptible to change. Considering that many patients live in rural areas, the introduction of telemedicine has become more and more popular. According to a Springer Nature article [source](https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/s11894-020-0751-0), telemedicine is a safe and effective approach in IBD care. Additionally, it helps reduce the financial burden of managing chronic disease, enhances patient quality of life, and contributes to better clinical outcomes.


### User Research and Persona Creation:

For user research, I used interviews as well as secondary research. The reason is that the user base for a chronic health app specifically tailored to patients with IBD is rather small. The reason behind these two options is that the secondary literature on the topic of IBD and telemedicine is quite large, and interviews can be conducted with a small audience.
